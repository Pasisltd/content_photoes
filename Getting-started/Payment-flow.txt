# üîπ Pasis Payment Flow

## Fundamentals

At **Pasis Money Transfer**, transactions are the heart of our payment system. The following principles explain how funds move across our platform:

- **Send (Pay):** Transfer money from your Pasis account to a mobile wallet, bank account, or another Pasis user.  
- **Receive (Top-Up):** Add money into your Pasis account from a mobile wallet, bank account, or Paymen partner.

## Transaction Lifecycle

Each transaction in Pasis goes through different stages. As a business partner or user, you can monitor the status of your transactions in real time through the **Pasis Dashboard**.

### 1. Transaction Creation

When a transaction request reaches Pasis servers, our system performs several checks:

  **Source validation** ‚Äì ensuring the request is from a trusted partner or account.  
  **Request structure validation** ‚Äì all required details are present.  
  **Uniqueness validation** ‚Äì to prevent duplicate payments.

If all checks pass, the transaction is created and moves to the next stage.

### 2. Successful Transaction

A transaction is successful when:

- The customer completes the payment process.  
- The payment is authorised by the provider (bank, wallet, or partner).  
- Funds are securely moved from the customer‚Äôs account to the recipient‚Äôs account.  

Both parties receive a confirmation notification.

### 3. Failed Transaction

A transaction is marked failed if:

- The customer cancels or drops out of the payment process.  
- Payment authorisation is denied (insufficient balance, wrong PIN, expired card, etc.).  
- Technical errors prevent fund transfer.  

> In this case, no money is deducted from the customer‚Äôs account.

### 4. Pending Transaction

A transaction may remain pending due to:

- Network delays  
- Mobile money or bank downtime  
- Technical interruptions  

When pending, the transaction is ‚Äúin progress‚Äù until confirmation is received:

- If completed ‚Üí it becomes **Successful**  
- If not completed after retries ‚Üí it becomes **Failed**
