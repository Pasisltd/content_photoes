## Rate Limiting
#   Rate Limiting at Pasis Money Transfer

At **Pasis Money Transfer**, we use **rate limiting** to control how many requests are sent to our servers at a time. 
Don’t worry,it’s not because our servers can’t handle traffic.
It helps us **keep everything running smoothly** and ensures we can **grow and scale** easily in the future.

## How It Works
Each application connected to Pasis has its own limit.
This means if you have multiple apps, each one gets its own “request allowance,” so one busy app doesn’t slow down the others.

## How to Know You’ve Hit the Limit
Right now, the limit is **300 requests per minute per application**.
If you reach this, you’ll need to wait a little before sending more requests. Soon, we’ll allow **custom limits** so you can adjust based on your app’s needs.

With Pasis, your money transfers stay **fast, reliable, and scalable**—no matter how many people are using the service!
