## Idempotency

Idempotency Overview 

Sometimes, internet connections fail, and a money transfer request might be sent more than once.
This could accidentally send money twice.

To prevent this, Pasis Money Transfer uses idempotency.
This means you can safely retry a transaction without worrying about duplicates.

What is an Idempotency Key?

An idempotency key is a unique code you create for each transaction. 
It helps the system know if a request is a retry of the same transaction.
You can use a random code or a UUID. Once a transaction is processed, the system remembers it.

How to Use It?

When sending money, just add this header in your request:

Idempotency-Key: <your-unique-key>

This ensures that even if the request is sent again, the system will not process it twice.
